  number, y indicates an intermediate change, z indicates a minor change.
o The tag for each revision is applied to the VStar SourceForge Subversion 
  repository. By navigating to that URL, the files that made up that release
  can be viewed.
o The subversion/git logs reveal the full details of what went into each 
  release and who contributed what. The Key Changes sections below just 
  summarise the key changes and features for each release, but are based 
  upon log entries.

Known Issues:
o WWZ is brittle in the presence of gaps in the data. See ticket 328.
o VStar "leaks" memory with ongoing use. The WebStart JNLP file and 
  VStar.{sh,exe,app} files specify a larger-than-default heap, which 
  helps significantly. If VStar becomes unresponsive, restart it, or 
  increase the maximum heap memory (currently -Xmx500m) when running 
  via the local VStar.{sh,bat} file. This problem is being addressed 
  over time. See ticket 108.

Date: May 27 2018
Version: 2.20.0
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-27May2018
Key Changes:
- Java 8 (or higher) is now required
- Fixed MJD to JD calculation in Catalina Sky Survey obs source plugin after 
  bug found by Velimir Popov (MJD+2400000.5 necessary instead of MJD+2400000).
- Updated TBGR series colors after discussion with Sara and request for change.
- ASAS-SN observation source plugin.
- #559 Loess plugin fixes; localisation; added reference URL.
- #605 Hardwired AUIDs no longer work: 
       o Changed title of Citizen Sky list to "10-Star Tutorial list (North)" 
         and added Southern Gems as "11-Star Tutorial list (South)" as per 
         Sara/HQ's suggestion.
       o Selecting a star from a group in the star selector dialog now sets 
         the Star text box and the dialog can no longer be dismissed if this 
         text box is empty. Probably should always have operated this way.
         In any case, this forces the star info to be looked up online rather 
         than relying upon hard-coded AUIDs.
- #602 Non-numeric uncertainty value causing NullPointerException (fixed)
- #609 Adapt to new APASS/AAVSONet Photometry URL
- #612 All bands erroneously loaded for some stars via scripting API (fixed)

       non-determinism that took me awhile to track down.
- #613 Handle DASCH format change (fixed)
- #364 VeLa
       o now Turing Complete
       o selection, iteration, sequence rules
       o made all keywords, variable and function names case insensitive
       o integer, boolean types and operations
       o heterogenous list literals, IN operator, map, reduce, filter, ...
       o exponentiation operator
       o regular expressions
       o variables; pi, e bindings
       o higher order functions including anonymous functions, closures;
         functions can be overloaded by parameter type
       o I/O (print, format, nextchar) functions
       o implemented eval function
       o VeLa script runner and read-eval-print loop script for VeLa in VeLa
       o model functions are now VeLa functions for use in Models dialog
       o added functions by reflection from Math and String classes

Date: April 30 2016
Version: 2.17.0
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-30Apr2016
Key Changes:

Date: January 11 2016
Version: 2.16.10
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-11Jan2016
Key Changes:
- Fixed bug in which raw mode polynomial fits gave errors; introduced after 
  adding phase plot mode polynomial fit feature in 2.16.9
- Removed need for authentication or giving special treatment to member plug-ins 
  from plugin-manager; note that member-only plug-ins still require authentication 
  at run-time.
- Ticket #304 Find minima/maxima of a model: first implementation of a
  derivative-based extrema finder to replace the previous optimiser 
  implementation; works best when a suitably uncomplicated light curve 
  section is selected.
- Ticket #400: Made all "New Star from File..." menu items plug-in based
  and changed AAVSO upload obs src to show line-based progress
- Ticket #161: Permit URL instead of file as data source for AAVSO download 
  format; this followed without effort after #400 was completed.
- Ticket #487: Warn if file will be overwritten in save operations
- Ticket #488: Request confirmation for star group deletion
- Ticket #499: Authentication failure leaves discrepant hidden but unreported 
- Ticket #505: BSM Epoch Photometry source field: handling source field in such 
  a way that it will work whether or not the field is present. Updates for BSM 
  2015 data release.
- Ticket #436: Plug-in Manager: install from local: added local directory
  selection button in preferences pane and internal changes to allow http
  or file streams for plug-ins.
- Ticket #430: Observation list: Save: Allow phase phase plot list to be saved
  Also, model, mean, residuals lists can also now be saved in phase plot mode.
- Scripting API modified to allow mean, model, residuals to be saved; light 
  curve vs phase plot mode must be explicitly requested before calling these 
  now, a change in behaviour!
- Added DCDFT to scripting API.
- Ticket #506: Synthetic obs list in phase mode should always use standard 
  phase.
- Ticket #509 Make default JD range slightly into future for AID loads.
  Thanks to Ken for the suggestion which has crossed my mind also.

- Changed period-luminosity distance calculator menu item name and
  description.

Date: July 17 2014
Version: 2.16.2
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-17Jul2014
Key Changes:
- Re-implemented authorization (using Will's new API) for member plug-ins,
  discrepant reporting, plug-in manager.
- Added support for additional file extensions in observation source 
  plug-ins.
- Added support for file-or-URL input method for observation source plug-ins
  and converted ASAS, Kepler, and Catalina Sky Survey plug-ins to use this. 
- Fixed ticket 151: Fields containing commas in CSV Download format files.
- Made DCDFT harmonic dialog period fields editable so user can modify them
  if so desired, e.g. to try doubling/halving a period. Thanks to Mark 
  Blackford for the suggestion.
- Observers-by-series plug-in by Paul York, a May/June VStar CHOICE course
  participant, now trying his hand at plug-in development. Thanks Paul.
- Changed Period-Luminosity Relationship Distance calculator to refer to 
  Leavitt's Law as per George Sjoberg's suggestion during the May/June CHOICE
  course. I also recall seeing this suggestion on an AAVSO forum and, like so 
  many others, admire the work of Henrietta Swan Leavitt.
- Ticket 376: for file-based additive load with no AID dataset involved, 
  RA and Dec dialogs are now opened to enable the HJD conversion to occur.
  Thanks to Sebastian Otero for asking a forum question about this that
  made me raise its priority.
- User manual updates and various internal utility code enhancements.

Date: June 26 2014
Version: 2.16.1
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-26Jun2014
Key Changes:
- Re-enabled Plug-in Manager, discrepant reporting post-security breach.
- Removed authorisation calls for plug-in manager and discrepant reporting
  and changed the discrepant report dialog to request explicit name or
  observer code.
- Member-only plug-ins (APASS, BSM) will not be visible in Plug-in Manager,
  nor work again, until an alternative authentication mechanism (in 
  development) is established (since they require run-time authentication).
- Fixed ticket 448: Star info: show RA epoch in Info dialog for AID loads.
- Added star naming section to user manual, thanks to Mike Simonsen.
- Incorporated feedback for improvement and corrections from May/June 2014 
  CHOICE course participants. Thanks to Paul York and Brad Walter.
- Fixed null pointer exception in ObserverListFilter reported by Bruno in 
  VStar course.  
- Changed model description dialog to use tabs for functions, metrics, 
  extrema, permitting growth in such descriptive information and more 
  suitable for equations with many terms (e.g. polynomial or Fourier).
- Permitting period analysis plug-ins to return null result dialog values
  to mean "no result dialog", e.g. due to an error/cancellation.
- Fixed ticket 441: Plug-ins: PeriodAnalysisPluginBase constructor calls
  mediator. This prevented period analysis plug-ins being used with
  WebStart launched VStar.
- Current mode ANOVA plug-in: shows ANOVA for current plot's mean, raw or 
  phase plot. Written during VStar CHOICE course.
- Internal improvements to make possible more flexible period analysis
  and other plug-in types, e.g. for forthcoming AoV period analysis plug-in.
- Added plug-ins build script "aavso" target to generate plug-in zip and 
  list file for AAVSO distribution.

Key Changes:
- Initial French localisation. Thanks to Dominique Naillon for the translations 
  and to Sara Beck for liasing with him. Any remaining problems should be attributed 
  to me.
- Fixed #378 in which some polynomial fits produced incorrect equations; replaced
  TS polynomial fitter with Apache Commons Math for this purpose but also for its 
  additional features (e.g. for goodness of fit criteria, extrema finding). Updated 
  Apache Commons Math library to gain additional functionality in the process.
- Added Ant build script for "official" plugins. Thanks to Adam Weber for this.
  This will be further adapted in future for use by other plugin developers.

Date: May 19 2013
Version: 2.15.2
Tag: DEV-AAVSO-19May2013
Key Changes:
- Fixed ticket 373: BSM/APASS URL creation used the user's locale not that 
  of the server. Thanks to Pierre Hallsten for reporting this and testing 
  the fix.

  encouraging me to implement this (at NACAA 2012) and for his help in 
  deciphering the ASAS format and providing advice and testing.
- Fixed ticket 369: Except for visual and V, the mean series source should 
  be the one with the most observations.
- Now extracting flux and CCD X,Y fields in the SuperWASP observation source
  plugin. See ticket 242.

- Implemented authentication framework for plugins, initially for use in some 
  observation source plugins. Citizen Sky authentication is not permitted for this, 
  or anywhere else in VStar now, only AAVSO web credentials.
- First working cut of additive dataset loading with HJD conversion. Currently, 
  file-based datasets can be added to an already loaded dataset. 
- Fixed Catalina Sky Survey plugin to use comma not space as the field delimiter.
- Fixed bug in AAVSO upload plugin in which the column headers comment line was 
  treated as an invalid observation rather than being ignored.
- Fixed a bug in which a user-defined series would not always appear on the plot 
  by default when created; other small user-defined series improvements.
- Fixed series visibility checkboxes so as to not be disabled when selected and 
  the series observation count goes to zero (e.g. discrepant), permitting the
  checkbox to be subsequently deselected, making the series invisibile.

Date: December 17 2012
Version: 2.14.2

  and used this extend the detail captured by SuperWASP, Kepler, and CSS plug-ins.
- Added the ability to manage and recall previous filters from View menu.
- Added the ability to create user defined series from previous filters dialog.
- Updated plug-in development document re: model creator plug-ins, additional build
  information, and plug-in implementation examples and details.
- Exposed DCDFT and WWZ via toolbar buttons; thanks again to Nico for the new icons!
  
Date: November 3 2012
Version: 2.14.1
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-AAVSO-03Nov2012
Key Changes:
- Fixed http authentication handling in observation source plug-in and model 
  creator plug-in object construction in a WebStart context.
- Improvements to Ant build script.
 
Date: October 26 2012
Version: 2.14.0
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-AAVSO-26Oct2012
Key Changes:
- Added series to binning result and ANOVA result text.
- Added phase, error (uncertainty), object name filter matching.
- Added dot size per series preference dialog tab. See tracker 2843087.
- Added more functions to scripting API to support generation and saving of phase plots.
- Added splash screen invocation in launch scripts and JNLP.
- Re-created SeriesType as a class rather than an enum to permit new series to be added.
- Set specific series types in observation source plugins (e.g. Kepler).
- First cut of Spanish localisation. Many but not all strings have been localised. 
  See tracker 3059737.
- Added a model creator plugin base and created Apache Commons Math polynomial and Lowess 
  fit plugins. Converted TS polynomial fitter to a model plugin. Plugin class refactoring 
  and change to observation tool plugin method signature to permit passing of series to 
  observation map instead of a single series. Localisation changes re: menu items.
- Added object name field matcher.
- Added APASS and BSM ob source plugins with some plugin architecture changes to file 
  and URL handling.
- Added support for HJD date type in AAVSO upload format observation source plugin.
- Added aa Cas and s Ori datasets (for use as CLEANest examples) to data directory.
- Fixed duplicate legend rendering on phase plots.
- Fixed tracker 3515182: View menu Phase Plot item disabled but ticked.
- Fixed a null pointer exception when creating a polynomial fit after a phase plot.
- Fixed a null pointer exception when creating a mean curve for phase plot.
- Period analysis algorithms were receiving out of order observations, ordered by phase 
  vs JD. This caused problems with WWZ JD range calculations when expecting in-order 
  observations. Now for all analysis algorithms, raw in-order data is passed.
- Fixed a null-pointer exception when the power spectrum line graph was being selected. 
- Fixed bug in AAVSO upload format observation source plugin in which whitespace around
  field values and directives (e.g. as generated by AIP4Win) caused dataset load failures.
- Build infrastructure improvements (added findbugs target to ant build file and javadoc 
  directory to clean target).

Date: April 4 2012
Version: 2.13
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-AAVSO-04Apr2012
Key Changes:
- Fixed a bug in which a mean source series selection (in plot control dialog) 
  of filtered, model, or residuals was not being reflected in the dialog across 
  invocations.
- Fixed a bug in which the plot control dialog failed to open for fainter-than-only 
  dataset.
- Renamed AID host to generic name in response to a request from AAVSO.
- Applied logarithmic checkbox state to all series in DCDFT result dialog.
- Added a show-top-hits checkbox in DCDFT result dialog.
- Fixed bug in which AAVSO text input was not ignoring column header comments.
- Changes to about box and ReadMe text.
- Removed incorrect Help comment about needing a login for AID download and
  incorrect statements in period search section.
- Changed "Search" button to "Apply" in observation list pane. 
- Added Mac OS X and DOS launcher applications and Linux launcher shell script.
  Thanks to Nico Caramgo for additional icons and my son Nicholas (aka NSDBPro)
  for help with the DOS launcher. This is intended for use when running locally 
  to provide the same JVM startup parameters as for WebStart.
- Fixed null pointer exceptions for some AAVSO download format columns in 
  observation list. 
- Added ability to generate a Filter series from an observation list selection.
- This is the first formal release since February 2011, but there have been 
  seven testing releases since that time. The change log entries for these below
  should be consulted for details, but here is a brief summary of the most 
  important additions in version 2.2:
  o Additional modes of invoking DC DFT (standard scan and by frequency or period).
  o Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform for time-frequency analysis.
  o Ability to create multiple-period models, including harmonics, from period 
    analysis (DC DFT) and to obtain Fourier series equation representing model.
  o Addition of search/filtering capability in observation list pane.  
  o Improvements to user interface and memory usage.
  o Numerous bug fixes.
  o Initial implementation of VStar scripting (JavaScript only currently) and API.
  o Improvements to plug-in infrastructure, fixes to some plug-ins, additional 
    plug-ins.
  o The ability to exclude observations as an alternative to mark-as-discrepant.
    Multiple observations can be selected in the observation list and excluded 
    together. The Edit menu supports undo of this.
    
Date: February 4 2012
Version: 2.13 (testing release 7)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-04Feb2012
Key Changes:
- Removed duplication of mean series in phase plot that wasted memory and
  lead to asymmetry in mean curves. This also avoids the need to duplicate 
  other synthetic series (e.g. Model, Residuals).
- Added ability to show polynomial fit coefficients via the Models dialog; 
- Increased maximum polynomial degree from 20 to 30.
- Fixed stop request handling in algorithm and modelling code. See tracker 
  3429612.
- Removed use of set-always-on-top method for dialogs, instead obtaining 
  current active window and using that as the parent of a dialog to be opened. 
  See tracker 3418412.
- Added DCDFT top-hits handles on power spectrum and other plots to make it
  easier to select points of interest on plots.

Date: November 28 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 6)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-28Nov2011
Key Changes:
- Implemented relative amplitudes and phases. See tracker 3416010. 
- The File->Info dialog now contains more information about the dataset's 
  source (e.g. AID, AAVSO download format file) and designation.

Date: November 4 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 5)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-04Nov2011
Key Changes:
- Fixed a bug reported by Brian Kloppenborg in WWZ in which for some values 
  of number-of-time-divisions, the number of time values was being cut well 
  short of the end of the JD range under test. Also cleaned up some WWZ code. 
  See tracker 3062273.

Date: October 21 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 4)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-21Oct2011
Key Changes:
- Freeing listeners at new-star and dialog dismissal to avoid memory leaks and
  to prevent messages being received by old (not yet garbage collected) objects
  along with the attendant index-out-of-range and other errors.
- Added loadFromAID() and saveCurrentData() in scripting API. See tracker 3205296.
- Implemented cross-hair setting on DCDFT power spectrum when harmonic selected 
  in list dialog. To use: Select a frequency (e.g. in top-hits table), switch to 
  frequency vs power plot, click "Find Harmonics". Selecting entries in list will 
  change the cross-hairs on the plot. See also 3416010.
- WWZ 2D plots are now combined scatter plots and line plots, making points of 
  interest more easily selectable. This may also be used in DCDFT in future for
  the same reason.
- A discrepant observation may now be reported to AAVSO when the discrepant 
  checkbox at the end of an observation list row is selected, as well as via
  an observation detail dialog. It's still the case that such a report may be
  lodged only when the dataset was loaded directly from the AID.
- Fixed a bug in which the JD of mean phase data items was being accessed, 
  but not available.
- Fixed index-out-of-bounds error in WWZ plot period analysis selection 
  handler.
- Fixed missing band information in WWZ-derived model and residual datapoints.

Date: October 4 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 3)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-04Oct2011
Key Changes:
- Added ability to show model function (if model supports it, e.g. from DCDFT).
  See tracker 3415901. 
- Fixed a problem with filtering (reported by Bikeman) in the presence of 
  fainter-than, discrepant, or excluded observations. See tracker 3416010.
- Added harmonics-per-period input dialog for modeling.
- Changed refinement parameter dialog to show user selected frequencies but 
  not to request harmonics for each period. See tracker 3416010.

Date: September 23 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 2)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-23Sep2011
Key Changes:
- Fixed multiple-line read bug in AAVSO upload format plugin.
- Fixed min/max value determination method in WWZ.
- Fixed WWZ contour plot scale bug when WWZ value min and max are equal.
- Added window-always-on-top permission to security policy to permit 
  plugins to call setAlwaysOnTop() in dialog code.
- Converted Kepler observation source plugin to use v2.0 Kepler FITS file 
  format. Thanks to Doug Welch for pointing out the need to do this.

Date: September 16 2011
Version: 2.13 (testing release 1)
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-16Sep2011
Key Changes:
- Added online docs link to Help menu where platform supports the Java 1.6 Desktop 
  API. See tracker 2960025.
- Added a default security policy to be applied at run-time such that all 
  code, including plug-in code will have the same permissions as core VStar 
  code when VStar is WebStarted.
- Implemented CLEANest period analysis refinement algorithm; translated from AAVSO 
  TS Fortran code by Grant Foster and Matthew Templeton.
- Implemented WWZ time-frequency analysis algorithm; translated from AAVSO Fortran
  code by Grant Foster and Matthew Templeton.
- Added model creation capability from period analysis results. Polynomial fit
  is treated as a special case of model creation. See See tracker 3205278.
- Series selection dialog added for period analysis and polynomial fit instead of 
  relying upon mean source series. See tracker 3205278. 
  Previously created models can be selected/deleted via a dialog.  
- Implemented regular expression pattern based search in observation list. See
  tracker 3377202.
- Now only saving observations in view in observation list. See tracker 3043078. 
- Implemented saving and printing for synthetic lists (means, model, residuals).
  See tracker 2859260. In all cases, the resulting TSV file can be opened as a
  dataset of unspecified band. CSV vs TSV should be a preference. 
- Observation table now reflects visible plot series unless "all data" checkbox
  is selected or pattern search is in effect.
- Extended file save-as dialog to permit column delimiter to be selected. See 
  tracker 2859260. 
- Enabled observation detail dialog for model and residuals list row selection.
- VStar DC DFT top hits table values and ordering differed from the AAVSO's 
  TS Fortran code on which it is based. This has been fixed. See tracker 3252674. 
- Selection of top hits rows and notification of top hit row selections is now 
  being handled consistently.
- Fixed period analysis table column sorting. See tracker 3144140.
- Added back DC DFT standard scan in addition to existing frequency scan.
- Fix for discrepant reporting locale bug. See tracker 3260287.
- Implemented a plugin to determine time between maxima/other events of interest, 
  e.g. outbursts. See tracker 3028947. Thanks to Mike Simonsen for requesting this.
- Additional work on upload file format observation source plugin to handle both 
  visual and extended formats. A few people requested this, including Ken Mogul 
  and Alan Plummer.
- Changed text format observation validation to permit magnitudes with no digits 
  after the decimal point. See tracker 2915572.
- Lifted range checking of magnitude values given the diversity of observation 
  sources.
- Busy progress bar and wait cursor now indicate threaded phase plot creation.
- Added a phase plots dialog that permits earlier plots to be re-created. 
- Implemented undoable/redoable edits mechanism, initially to support observation 
  observation exclusion (useful for noisy datasets, e.g. SuperWASP).
- Moved "uncertainty" into a separate sortable observation table column, making it
  easier to perform en masse observation exclusions.
- Multiple observation table rows can now be selected and used to exclude observations 
  via Edit menu.
- Moved confidence interval and ANOVA info from plot to Info dialog and reduced plot
  title clutter generally. See tracker 3304592.
- Added support for making period analysis plot ranges axis logarithmic and enabled
  for DC DFT power spectrum (log10(power)) and example plug-in. Requested by Doug 
  Welch.
- Added period range GUI specification for DC DFT and WWZ.
- Added getGroup() method to plug-in base class; may return null, but otherwise can be 
  used to keep separation between different groups of plug-ins (e.g. DC DFT or WWZ 
  related).
- Ensuring observations are sorted, given out of order sources encountered. See
  tracker 3274046.
- Permitting files with rows delimited by whitespace to be loaded. See tracker 
  3304602.
- Implemented stop button in GUI; works for file-based observation source and 
  period analysis tasks, but not yet for database observation loads.
- Initial implementation of VStar scripting (JavaScript only currently).
- Fixed a bug in which malformed non-string database rows (JD, mag) aborted 
  observation reads. See tracker 3315363.
- Fixes and refactorings to propagate polynomial fit visibility from raw to 
  phase plot modes. See tracker 3315433.
- Fixed handling of filtered series in phase plot view. See tracker 3315433. 
- Re-designed and updated About Box.
- Added top-level DOS and shell scripts to invoke VStar with the same Java 
  VM parameters as JNLP (Web Start). These can be run from anywhere. Thanks
  to Mike Umbricht for helping to improve the DOS batch file. 
- Added --noplugins command-line switch to disable loading of plugins. Suggested
  by Mike Umbricht.
- Small documentation improvements (mostly by Mike Umbricht).
- Additional unit tests, especially for new modelling, CLEANest, WWZ 
  functionality.
- Other small bug fixes.

Date: February 28 2011
Version: 2.12
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-28Feb2011
Key Changes:
- Fix for tracker 3184726 in which marking a point discrepant causes means 
  series to be displayed.
- Minor updates to help contents re: authentication.
- Handled the case where no visual or "unspecified" observations are present:
  all series are now displayed (tracker 3188139).
- Added plugin jar creation helper script to plugin/script.
- Fix for tracker 3189219 in which the magnitude observation list column was 
  not sorting when clicked, instead generating an error.
- Now propagating the light curve's series visibility to the first phase plot 
  and thereafter, preserving the series visibility across phase plots for a 
  single dataset. See tracker 3004885.
- First version of AAVSO extended file format observation source plugin.
  Thanks to Ken Mogul for providing the first impetus for this in the
  guise of being able to read VPHOT output.
- Since filtering currently has no effect in phase plot mode, the relevant
  view menu items and toolbar button are now disabled in that mode.
  
Date: February 15 2011
Version: 2.11
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-15Feb2011
Key Changes:
- Fixed tracker 3108092: Locale specific problem for "New Phase Plot". Thanks to
  Heinz for reporting and testing this, and for his patience.
- Created plot control dialog box and removed plot control pane from observation
  panes to leave more room for what is of primary interest to the VStar user: the 
  data. See the new section in the help documentation for details.
- Combined two plot tabs per mode into a single plot tab with mean series 
  initially not visible.
- If the bin size (now in plot control dialog) is not greater than zero, an
  error message box is opened. See tracker 3147505. Thanks to Wolfgang for 
  raising these and other trackers (3147507, 3147511, 3147512).
- Fixed a bug in which phase steps per bin of greater than 1 were allowed. 
  See tracker 3147505.
- Changed default phase steps to 0.01. See tracker 3147505.
- Fixed a bug in which setting an observation as discrepant was always 
  recalculating the mean series irrespective of whether the current mean 
  source series was the series of the marked observation. 
- Made all dialogs either modal or always-on-top. Motivated by trackers 
  3147512 and 3147511.
- Added preferences for numeric precision and propagated to all output
  and, where appropriate, some input dialog entry boxes. See trackers 
  3147507 and 3147509.
- Fixed tracker 3151183: SuperWASP plug-in magnitude error threshold 
  increment.
- Added tool-tip text to show JD/phase and magnitude when mouse is over 
  a data point.
  
Date: December 22 2010
Version: 2.10
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-22December2010
Key Changes:
- Implemented domain and range panning (tracker 2952532). Note that this permits
  left, right, up, and down panning while zoomed in. When reaching the left and 
  right time limits, panning stops. In future, somewhat like Zapper, we will ask 
  the user whether more data should be retrieved when in database mode. 
- Removed toolbar button borders and incorporated improved icons (size and 
  alignment) from Nico Camargo.
- Split info dialog into summary and series sections.
- Implemented last observation selection across all views (plots, tables).
  This permits filtering based upon selected observation and another way of
  opening the observation details dialog (see next point). In addition, when
  selecting a table row, the cross-hair and selected observation is reflected
  in plots.
- The observation details dialog is now opened by double-clickng on a data point
  or via the Observation Details view menu item or toolbar button with Nico's
  awesome new X-ray icon.
- Removed authentication for obscode filter when dataset is from AID, after
  discussion with Sara Beck. In future this may again be configurable via 
  the Preferences dialog, but being asked to authenticate when selecting a 
  filter dialog matcher is a little disruptive, hence the removal. As Sara
  said, people tend to remember their own observer code. 
- Removed non-ubiquitous window transparency code as used by the observation
  details dialog (tracker 3106625).
- Removed bogus unprintable UTF-8 character in commented code that caused 
  build failure under Linux.
- Updated Help docs re: panning, filtering, observation details dialog etc.

Date: November 9 2010
Version: 2.9
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-09November2010
Key Changes:
- Toolbar: added polynomial fit button and changed phase plot button icon.
- Fixed broken JNLP file reported by a Citizen Sky participant (Bikeman).
- Fixed a bug in which toolbar icons became active after failure to load 
  data from AID or file, permitting for example, the Info button or File 
  menu item to be selected when no valid dataset was loaded.
- Maximum magnitude values for plot ranges were being calculated 
  incorrectly for magnitude values less than zero. This was discovered
  while developing a Kepler FITS observation source plug-in with Doug Welch.
- Locale-sensitive number parsing was being used in some places where
  Double.parseDouble() should have been used, leading to parsing errors.
  Thanks again to Bikeman for reporting this and testing the fix.
- Re-designed observation source plug-ins to work around the WebStart 
  sandbox that prevented observation source plug-ins from opening a file 
  dialog. 
- Added sections regarding limitations and use of libraries to plug-in 
  development document.
  
Date: October 28 2010
Version: 2.8
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-28October2010
Key Changes:
- The addition of Nico's beautiful toolbar icons.

Date: October 26 2010
Version: 2.7
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-26October2010
Key Changes:
- Fixed a bug in which what was being saved (via the save button or File 
  menu item) could be out of sync with the current tab (plot, list) selection.
- Changed polynomial degree slider to show values while slider still in 
  motion.
- Created a plug-ins directory with examples and a SuperWASP observation 
  reader. The latter was suggested by Doug Welch.
- Changed default discrepant series color to light gray as per Aaron Price's 
  original request, now that the plot background is white.
- Implemented the modified AAVSO/CS login proposal of tracker 2926878. Login
  is now only required for discrepant reporting and observer code retrieval
  when the dataset has been loaded from the AAVSO International Database.

Date: September 29 2010
Version: 2.6 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-29September2010
Key Changes:
- Fixed number parsing bug reported by Citizen Sky participant, Bikeman. See 
  tracker 3059737. 
- Implemented and system-tested discrepant reporting. See tracker 2937949.
- Implemented observation source plug-in capability and updated plug-in 
  development document. See tracker 2983857.
- Several small GUI fixes.
- Updated Help docs re: polynomial fit, plug-ins.

Date: September 2 2010
Version: 2.5 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-02September2010
Key Changes:
- Fixed handling of V and T valflags in AAVSO download format.
- Fixed NaNs in confidence interval calculation. 
- Changed save-as format to TSV vs CSV to avoid lossy nature of save up 
  to now in the presence of comment fields containing commas. 

Date: August 31 2010
Version: 2.4 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-31August2010
Key Changes:
- Implemented polynomial fit. See the Analysis menu and tracker 2983862.
- Changes to ANOVA after feedback from Grant and Aaron: added between-group
  and within-group degrees of freedom to plot sub-title; for p-values of less 
  than < 0.000001, this is shown. See tracker 3005590.
- Frequency range and resolution can now be specified for DC DFT. This was
  prompted by a problem Arne reported re: a V703 Sco dataset. See tracker 
  3005601.

Date: August 24 2010
Version: 2.3 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-24August2010
Key Changes:
- Now also retrieving variable and spectral type from VSX along with
  discoverer (which appears often to be empty). See tracker 2926870.
- Implemented color preference persistence. See tracker 2843087.
- Incorporated generalised 10-star list in star selection dialog to permit 
  arbitrary star groups. This was initially motivated by the Southern Gems 
  Citizen Sky Team which is developing a southern equivalent of the 10-star 
  tutorial. A preferences dialog pane is now dedicated to star group
  maintenance. See tracker 3041516.
- Modified uncertainty values in mean observations to use Confidence Intervals
  rather than Standard Error of the Average (twice the latter) as per Grant 
  Foster's suggestion. Unit tests were updated to account for this change.
  See tracker 3031083.
- Added a tool plugin mechanism alongside period analysis plugins that permits 
  the currently loaded observations to be processed in arbitrary ways.
- Created a VStar plugin development PDF document (see doc directory). See 
  tracker 2983857.
- Added custom filter plugin capability.
- Added the Apache Commons Math library to the extlib directory; updated 
  extlib/ReadMe.txt re: licenses in preparation for anova algorithm addition.
- Implemented anova (F-test, p-value) as per Grant's request. See tracker
  3005590.
- Introduced another directory (vstar_plugin_libs) which can contain jars upon 
  which plugins are dependent. These are added to the list of jar URLs used by 
  the plugin class loading functionality. See also tracker 2983857.
- Added Javadoc generation to Ant files. These HTML docs are useful for VStar 
  and VStar plugin developers. The doc directory will contain periodically (e.g. 
  for new VStar versions) updated Javadocs and a zip archive of the these.                                                                              
- Introduced a component factory class to make it easy for the period analysis 
  plugin developer to create common components (e.g. plots, tables). See tracker 
  2983857.
- AAVSO download format file field validation fixes. See tracker 2915572.

Date: July 7 2010
Version: 2.2 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-07July2010
Key Changes:
- Initial implementation of observation filtering. See tracker 2870766.
  A filter dialog allows one or more matchers to be specified, all of
  which must match for an observation to be included in the filtered
  set of observations.
- The observer code is retrieved for a user authenticated against 
  Citizen Sky (if one has been assigned). See tracker 2952531.
- Added select-all and deselect-all buttons to series selection dialogs 
  (in observation and mean plots) permitting en-masse series selection
  and deselection. See tracker 2897886.
- Fixed zoom point selection handling so that an observation details dialog 
  does not first have to be opened before a Zoom In/Out operation can have
  effect after having clicked a point on a plot. 
   
Date: June 4 2010
Version: 2.1 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-04June2010
Key Changes:
- Switched to Java 1.6 as base Java Runtime Environment including minor
  changes to build infrastructure.
- Removed swing-worker jar from extlib since from JRE 1.6, the SwingWorker 
  class is in javax.swing package.
- Implemented table row sorting (sort by selected column) for observation 
  list, mean list, and DC DFT period analysis data and top hits tables. 
- Set transparency of observation detail dialogs to 70%. See tracker 2947383.
- Initial implementation of menu/tool-bar driven zoom. An observation must 
  currently have been selected (with observation details dialog opened) via 
  cross-hairs before a zoom will occur; this is likely to be relaxed in 
  future. Zoom for each plot/view-mode combination is currently independent, 
  but in future, plot zooms may instead be synchronised. See tracker 2827041.
     
Date: May 27 2010
Version: 2.0 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-27May2010
Key Changes:
- Changed main display to use tabbed panes instead of mode radio buttons 
  to better utilise screen real estate. See tracker 2983883. 
- Disabled JD field text entry in star selector dialog when the all-data 
  check-box is selected. See tracker 2986311.
- Fixed chart size to take into account error bars where they could
  previously go out of bounds; use HQ uncertainty when uncertainty 
  is zero. See tracker 2986297.
- When new star tasks end, the progress bar is now cleared.
- When changed via the Analysis menu or toolbar, raw data or phase plot 
  mode is indicated in the status bar.
- Period and epoch are now displayed on phase plots. See tracker 2980530.
- Increased the default size of the Error column in the invalid 
  observation table. See tracker 2944557.
- Implemented application properties (e.g. window location and size) which 
  are loaded at VStar startup and saved at VStar exit. See tracker 2937599.
- A new phase plot can now be initiated from a period analysis dialog. 
  See trackers 2942299 and 2981712.
- Added toolbar buttons for Analysis menu items. See tracker 2966046.
- Updated the Help page including the addition of Aaron's 5-star analysis 
  tutorial. See tracker 2980809. The Help page needs an overhaul.
- Fixed a bug in which selecting an already selected raw or phase plot 
  analysis menu item would cause that menu item to be shown as unselected
  (no check mark). See tracker 2997675.
- Moved the 10-star list into a resource file in preparation to permit a 
  user-provided list can be used instead. See tracker 2892659.
- When an unknown comment code is encountered in an observation, further
  comment code checking for that observation now stops, and "other" is used
  as the single comment code. Also made small changes to the text of some
  comment codes. See tracker 2909469.
- Fixed a bug in which an error (NullPointerException) occurred when marking 
  observations as discrepant in 2nd and subsequently loaded datasets, but only
  after at least one dataset has had a phase plot created. See tracker 3007948.
     
Date: March 30 2010
Version: 1.0 Beta
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-30Mar2010
Key Changes:
- Date Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DC DFT) period analysis 
  implemented. This is a translation from Matthew Templeton's and Grant 
  Foster's DC DFT Fortran code. Plots of amplitude vs period and frequency, 
  and data tables (all results, top hits) are used to visualise the result. 
  Period analysis is carried out on the series which is the source of the 
  mean curve series as selected in the observations and mean plot mode. See 
  tracker 2942299 and Help page for more details. This should be considered
  to be a first attempt at period analysis and may change.
- Selecting a point in a plot now affects table row selection and vice versa.
  Each plot pane now has a "show cross hairs?" checkbox so cross-hairs can be
  made invisible if desired. See tracker 2917612.
- Re-ordered a number of observation list columns. See tracker 2952041.
- Changed format of doubles for means (JD, phase, mag) to have 4 decimal 
  places. See tracker 2947381.
- Observation details dialogs now only have discrepant checkboxes if the 
  observation is not a mean observation.
- Means list printing now works (but not saving yet).
- Made data pane (containing plots and table) scrollable for small (e.g. 
  800x600) screen sizes. See tracker 2947376.
- Invalid data table column auto-resizing disabled, forcing horizontal 
  scroll-bar to appear when columns resize beyond visible bounds of 
  containing-pane. Also, the column containing the offending observation 
  has been increased in size to emphasise it. See tracker 2944557.
- Changed spacing between series checkboxes and radio buttons in series 
  change panes because the related dialogs (e.g. for Epsilon Aurigae) were 
  getting way too big for 1028x768 screens. See tracker 2978559 for more 
  details.
- Fixes for tracker 2955919 in which a single observation yielded an index 
  out of bounds exception.
- Fixes for tracker 2836600 (Days in means bin looks odd in full screen).
- Fixed tracker 2952564 (login dialog should be dismissable by hitting return).
- Fixed uncertainty value loading. We were never loading them from the 
  database! Also made validation of such values more robust for database 
  loads. See tracker 2975998.
- Fixed tracker 2913670 (deselection of all bands on a plot causes exception). 
- Consolidated treatment of pre-validation comment code in database (Z) and 
  download format (P). Changed comment code handling to permit any text so 
  we don't exclude otherwise good data. Any unknown comment code will be 
  treated as "other". See trackers 2915572, 2950557.
- Excluding observations with a valflag of "Y". Rationalised validation type 
  handling. Displaying human readable validation type instead of valflag 
  in observation list table. See tracker 2858633.
- Updated bands categories from database (see script directory re: how).
- Phases are only included in an observation details dialog if the current 
  analysis mode is "phase plots".
- The observation details dialog discrepant checkbox is now updated when an 
  observation is made discrepant from the observation list (or potentially 
  from anywhere else).
- Fixed JD/phase mean calculation. First and last in range were being averaged
  rather than all time values in the range. Mean magnitude values remain unchanged. 
  See tracker 2944549.
- Numerous internal code improvements and some additional test cases.
- Brought help document up to date with current feature set. See tracker
  2960025.
- Updated JNLP description element to take into account current stage of 
  development. See tracker 2901509. 

Date: February 2 2010
Version: 412
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-2Feb2010
Key Changes:
- Added proper notification and update of observation change (discrepant
  status in particular). An observation can be marked as discrepant in either 
  the obs list or the observation details dialog (obtained by clicking on 
  a plot data point) and all views including mean plots will be suitably 
  updated. See tracker 2837691.
- Implemented preferences dialog with a series colors tab since that's 
  something that's been requested recently and is useful. See tracker 
  2843087.
- Added support for saving observation list in simple and AAVSO file format.
  Database and AAVSO download format file originated observations yield
  AAVSO format CSV files. Fixed a problem with some saved fields when source 
  is database. More problems await when saving an obs list after loading from 
  the database. The reason is that we do not currently subject database sourced 
  obs to the same scrutiny as we do file loaded obs. See tracker 2940215.  
- Added an "all data" checkbox to the star selection dialog so min/max JD 
  doesn't have to be supplied if all data is required. Optimised the query
  in particular that case. Also fixed a bug in which the star field was not 
  being cleared when a 10-star item was selected. See tracker 2943278.
- Now treating database-loaded obs with HQ uncertainty values outside the 
  range 0..1 to be invalid. This was prompted due to a number of wildly 
  incorrect error bars on a small number of observations (since fixed by 
  AAVSO). See tracker 2915572.
- Changed exclusive range predicate to an inclusive range for uncertainty 
  values, i.e. 0..1 inclusive instead of 0 < x < 1. This avoids having so 
  many otherwise good file loaded objects from being considered invalid. 
  We should revisit this though. Talk with Elizabeth about it. See tracker 
  2915572.
- Changed regular expression in CommentType to relax comment code string 
  validation so we don't exclude otherwise good data. Anything not known by 
  CommentType will be treated as "other". See tracker 2915572.

Date: January 19 2010
Version: 392
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-19Jan2010
Key Changes:
- Clearing old lists and maps when creating artefacts for a new star
  and suggested subsequent garbage collection to VM in an effort to 
  reduce memory consumption and improve performance. See tracker 2924511.
- Incorporated phase plot analysis artefacts into all view modes. 
  See tracker 2926870.
- Changed series rendering order in plot in an attempt to improve
  visibility of means series in datasets with tightly packed plots.
  See tracker 2830059.
- Changed all data points in plots to be small circles for easier
  visibility. See tracker 2898494.
- Added information item to File menu and toolbar to provide summary
  information about loaded dataset. See tracker 2926870.
- Added handling of unexpected '0' comment code. See tracker 2933825.
- Fixed HQ uncertainty formatting error in which null values were being 
  shown in the observation list pane as "nu". See tracker 2933617.
- Fixed a bug in which File menu items were being disabled after an 
  unknown format error upon attempted file load. See tracker 2934762.
- Improved the symmetry of mean curves with respect to raw data plots
  and phase plots. This also fixes a bug in which some phase plot 
  mean curves showed out-of-sequence mean values for some datasets
  and small values of phase-elements-per-bin. See tracker 2902477.
- Various unit test infrastructure and code-base improvements.
  
Date: December 24 2009
Version: 361
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-24Dec2009
Key Changes:
- Added handling of magnitude type field for AAVSO download files, including 
  mtype enum, validator, unit tests. Handling mtype = STD filtering for 
  database reads. (2909476.)
- Add SS Cyg data to test mtype fix.
- Closing database result set in a try to avoid resource leak. (2919290)
- Fields are now uniformly trimmed of spaces (start and end) for both simple 
  and AAVSO download format files. (2913523)
- Add Phase Plot to Help page.
- Trimmed spaces from JD, star/AUID name, period and epoch text boxes. (2917874)
- Refactoring table model column info and field info classes. (2917611)
  Implemented phase plot table model column info classes. (2902477)
- Added file of WY Hya data showing the addition of the mtype field. (test file
  for 2909476)
- Fixes a range error when there is only one observation point in the set.
  (2908523 and 2907603)
- Applied commentfix.patch. (2858640)
- Added unit test for comment code validation.
- Fixed tracker 2913727 in which JD values were being rounded.

Date: December 13 2009
Version: 339M
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-13Dec2009
Key Changes:
- VStar retrieves VSX values for epoch and period.  These are used as the
  default initial values in Phase Plot.  Test database is used for VSX Unit
  tests.  Epoch and period values now persist when entering values for a New
  Phase Plot.  (2902477)
- The RJD value from VSX is now converted to HJD.  Modified Phase Plot labels
  and tooltips to clarify that epoch is HJD.  (2912793)
- Fix bug where a cancel of Phase Plot causes a replot of the chart.  (2913376)
- Add library .jar files and licenses to ./extlib with updates to ReadMe files.
  Add extlib source code and license info to Help with links to full licenses
  and library project homepages.  See tracker 2826668 for outstanding issue.
- Add title to Help windows (2898529) and other minor changes to Help text.
- Added vstar.jnlp.txt info file (ie. release notes) for vstar.jnlp for use at
  SourceForge Download Now page:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/vstar/files
- Applied Adam's comment code patch (2909469)

Date: December 6 2009
Version: 318M
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-6Dec2009
Key Changes:
- Converted VStar to use VSX for AUID and star name lookup; added more unit tests.
  See tracker entries: 2907485, 2893284 for more details.
- Minor changes to Citizen Sky references.
- Added a new FAQ about VStar database port and firewalls.
- Added descriptions for different contexts and tooltip to vstar.jlnp WebStart.
- Update/correct license for About box artwork.

Date: November 30 2009
Version: 310
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-30Nov2009
Key Changes:
- Fixed tracker entry 2902388 in which the phase plot pane would forget 
  selected bands when a new phase plot was generated. 
- Fixed a long-standing database port fail-over bug. See tracker 2894174.
- Decreased database timeout as per tracker 2905387.
- Incorporated Adam's patches and new classes for improvements to comment 
  field code and date format in observation details dialog (tracker 2858640).  
- Minor correction to license reference and another link to VStar source
  code (in Help page).

Date: November 22 2009
Version: 299MP
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-22Nov2009
Key Changes:
- A fix for tracker entry 2901383 in which clicking on a phase plot point in 
  the standard half (phase >=0) failed with a null pointer exception.
- Add minor note to Help about unsupported AAVSO download format.

Date: November 20 2009
Version: 294MP
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-20Nov2009
Key Changes:
- Fixed connection timeout and updated extlib/ReadMe.txt to stipulate the use 
  of the latest stable JDBC MySQL driver to fix bug in port usage. See tracker 
  entry 2894174 for details.
- Created this change log.
- Added some infrastructure for handling arbitrary long operation cancellation. 
  Not yet complete however. See tracker entry 2894174.
- Removed @Override annotations from a few source files that may cause some 
  compiler versions to generate errors.
    
Date: November 19 2009
Version: 29:281MP
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-19Nov2009
Key Changes:
- Fix for the username/password validation problem captured by tracker entry 
  2899357.
- Added Java WebStart management and Windows XP information to the FAQ.
- Clarified credit for illustration in About box.
- Added link to source code in Help Contents, and other small changes.

  is http://www.citizensky.org/teams/vstar-software-development
- Modified tooltip text to fix tracker entry 2897303.
- Added Beta Per and R Sct data files.

Date: November 13 2009
Version: 29:270MP
Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-13Nov2009
Key Changes:
- This was the first WebStart release of VStar to CitizenSky, the culmination
  of 6 months of work that began on May 9 2009. Much of the work between 
  Subversion revision 166 
  (http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-17Aug2009) and this
  release consisted of bug fixes, refactoring of the code base, improvements 
  due to feedback from David's Citizen Sky 1 talk, and the addition of a first cut 
  of phase plots.
