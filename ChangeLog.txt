Change Log
----------

Notes:
o Entries appear in reverse chronological order.
o The "Version" field should be considered to be an arbitrary unique label that 
  may change over time (e.g. from a Subversion revision to a build number).
  See Help->About in VStar.
o The tag for each revision is applied to the VStar SourceForge Subversion 
  repository. By navigating to that URL, the files that made up that release
  will be viewable.
o The Subversion log will reveal the full details of what went into each release 
  and who contributed what. The Key Changes sections below merely summarise key
  changes and features for each release, but are based directly upon Subversion
  log entries. For the detailed svn commit log comments see:

Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-13Nov2009
Key Changes:
- This was the first WebStar release of VStar to CitizenSky, the culmination

  Subversion revision 166 
  (http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-17Aug2009) and this
  release was bug fixes, refactoring of the code base, improvements due to 
  feedback from David's CitizenSky 1 talk, and the addition of a first cut 
  of phase plots.
