Change Log
----------

Notes:
o Entries appear in reverse chronological order.
o The "Version" field should be considered to be an arbitrary unique label that 
  may change over time (e.g. from a Subversion revision to a build number).
  See Help->About in VStar.
o The tag for each revision is applied to the VStar SourceForge Subversion repository.
  By navigating to that URL, the files that made up that release will be viewable. 
o The Subversion log will reveal the full details of what went into each release and
  who contributed what. The Key Changes sections below merely summarise key changes
  and features for each release, but are based directly upon Subversion log entries. 
o Bug & Issue tracker entries cited below can be found here:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=browse&group_id=263306&atid=1152052
o Major contributors are: David Benn, Michael Umbricht, Sara Beck, and Adam Weber.

Tag: http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-CS-13Nov2009 (r272)
Key Changes:
- This was the first WebStar release of VStar to CitizenSky, the culmination of 6
  months of work that began on May 9 2009. Much of the work between Subversion
  revision 166 (http://vstar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vstar/tags/DEV-17Aug2009/)
  and this release was bug fixes, refactoring of the code base, improvements due
  to feedback from David's CitizenSky 1 talk, and the addition of a first cut of
  phase plots.
