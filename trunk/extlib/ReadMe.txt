VStar is reliant upon a number of freely available Java libraries
("jar" files) that are not included with this distribution due to 
licensing restrictions, so must be obtained from the Internet 
separately. Some of these restrictions may be lifted, but further
investigation is necessary.

The following libraries must be present in the current directory 
for VStar to function. The jar file is given, along with the
web address from which to obtain it.

  o jcommon-1.0.16.jar (http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/)
  o jfreechart-1.0.13.jar (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/)
  o swing-worker-1.2.jar (https://swingworker.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList)
  o jlfgr-1_0.jar (http://java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/hi/repository/)
  o mysql-connector-java-5.1.10-bin.jar (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html)

This section categorises the libraries in terms of function:

 - JFreeChart related:
     jcommon-1.0.16.jar
     jfreechart-1.0.13.jar

 - Swing extras:
     swing-worker-1.2.jar
     
 - Java look and feel Graphics Repository:
     jlfgr-1_0.jar
     
 - MySQL JDBC:
     mysql-connector-java-5.1.10-bin.jar
     
If you are a developer who wishes to contribute toward coding or 
testing VStar, the following library must be downloaded for unit 
testing purposes:

 - JUnit 3.8.2:
     junit.jar (http://www.junit.org/)
