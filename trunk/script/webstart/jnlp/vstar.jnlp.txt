VStar is a statistical analysis tool for variable star observation data
developed for the American Association of Variable Star Observers 
(http://www.aavso.org/) and the Citizen Sky project

VStar can load observational data from files or the AAVSO International 
Database, display interactive light curves and phase plots, and perform 
period analysis.
 
VStar will run on any platform that has version 1.7 or later of the Java 
run-time environment. Go to https://www.aavso.org/vstar to download and run
