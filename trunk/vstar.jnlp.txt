VStar is a statistical analysis tool for variable star observation data
developed for the American Association of Variable Star Observers 
(http://www.aavso.org/) and the Citizen Sky project 
(http://www.citizensky.org/).

VStar can load observational data from files or the AAVSO International 
Database, display interactive light curves and phase plots, and perform 
period analysis.
 
VStar will run on any platform that has version 1.6 or later of the Java 
run-time environment. Download vstar.jnlp to install using Java WebStart.  
This version is the same as the one on the Citizen Sky website, where you 
can learn more about the VStar project:

You will also need to register for a free account on Citizen Sky to use the
download from AAVSO database feature of VStar.
