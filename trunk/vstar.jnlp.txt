VStar is an easy-to-use variable star data visualization tool. Data can be read
from a file or the AAVSO database and plotted as a light curve along with means
data and error bars. Phase plots are under development and period search
functions are planned.

This is a pre-release version of VStar.  It will run on any platform that has
version 1.5 or later of the Java run-time environment.  Download vstar.jnlp to
install using Java WebStart.  This version is the same as the one on the Citizen
Sky website, where you can learn more about the VStar project:

You will also need to register for a free account on Citizen Sky to use the
download from AAVSO database feature of VStar.
