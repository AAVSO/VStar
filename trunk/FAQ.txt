Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: I got an error message during startup with "Can't locate icon:

   /toolbarButtonGraphics/general/New24.gif"

A: This is because the application cannot find the jlfgr look and feel icons.
   Make sure the *.jar files are directly under extlib.

Q: Build and load a debugging version of Vstar?
A: 
   ant clean
   ant debug
   ant run_debug
   jdb -attach 8000
   stop in org.aavso.tools.vstar.ui.VStar.main
   use ${path up to src}
