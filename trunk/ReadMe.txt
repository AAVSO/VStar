This is VStar: a statistical analysis tool for variable star data
developed for the American Association of Variable Star Observers 
(http://www.aavso.org/) and the CitizenSky project (http://www.citizensky.org/).

The src directory contains the Java source code for the tool.

The test directory contains unit tests and test data.

The file build.xml is an Ant file used for building a VStar distribution jar 
file. Ant can be downloaded from http://ant.apache.org/ and 1.7.0 or higher 
is assumed.

VStar uses the following libraries:

- jcommon-1.0.16.jar
- jfreechart-1.0.13.jar
- mysql-connector-java-5.0.5-bin.jar (TODO: review)

For testing, JUnit 3.8.2 or higher is assumed (http://www.junit.org).
