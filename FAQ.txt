Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q1: I got an error message during startup with
"Can't locate icon: /toolbarButtonGraphics/general/New24.gif"

A1: This is because the application cannot find the jlfgr look and feel icons.
   Make sure the *.jar files are directly under extlib.


Q2: Build and load a debugging version of Vstar?

A2:
   ant clean
   ant debug
   ant run_debug
   jdb -attach 8000
   stop in org.aavso.tools.vstar.ui.VStar.main
   use ${path up to src}


Q3a: How do I add a shortcut to VStar on Windows XP?
Q3b: How do I remove VStar from Windows XP?

A3: This applies if you have installed VStar using WebStart from the Citizen Sky
website.  From the Start button select Control Panel.  Double click on the Java
icon.  In  the Java Control Panel look for Temporary Internet Files and click on
View.  The Java Cache Viewer will show VStar if it is installed.  Right click on
VStar.  You can select Install Shortcuts to put Vstar on the desktop and in a
program folder in the Start menu.  You can also select Delete to remove VStar
from your computer.


Q4: How do I manage a VStar WebStart install?

A4: In general you would use the Java Cache Viewer.  On Solaris type "javaws" at
the command line.  For Windows XP type "javaws -viewer" in a command window.
(also see the instructions above to start the Java Control Panel)  Other
operating systems should have a similar javaws command.

Q5: What ports does VStar use to connect to the AAVSO database?

Q6: VStar uses port 3307 to connect to the database to retrieve variable star
observations.  If there is no response it will then try 3306 after a timeout.
If you are using a firewall you should check to make sure that these ports are
open.
