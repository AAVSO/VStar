  <h1>VStar Help</h1>

<br></br><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>VStar is a multi-platform, easy-to-use variable star data visualization tool.</p>
<p>Its current capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Sourcing data from a file or the AAVSO International Database.</li>
 <li>Plotting a Light Curve or Phase Plot from raw observation data, 
 optionally with error bars for each observation.</li>
 <li>Showing a table of the raw observations associated with the light curve.</li>
 <li>Plotting a mean light curve (again, with optional error bars) along with
 the raw light curve.</li>
 <li>Showing a table of mean observations along with the standard error of the
 average for each.</li>
 <li>Performing period analysis.</li>
 <li>Filtering observations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plots mentioned above have magnitude on the Y axis and Julian Day (or 
phase) on the X axis.</p>

<p>When the <code>Mean Plot</code> tab is
selected, the number of days per bin size can be specified. This will change
both the plot and the means table (see the <code>Mean List</code> tab).</p>

<p>VStar allows data to be loaded from one of two file formats or from the AAVSO
International Database (AID).</p>

<br></br><h2>Loading Observation Data from a File</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>New Star from File...</code> from the File menu or clicking
the equivalent toolbar icon opens a file dialog from which a file of one of two
formats can be loaded:</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href="http://www.aavso.org/data/download/downloadformat.shtml">AAVSO
 download format</a> (CSV and TSV formats only currently, not VOTable)</li>
 <li>Lines of the form: Julian Day,Magnitude,[Uncertainy],[Observer Code],[Validation Flag]
 or simply: Julian Day,Magnitude</li>
</ol>

<p>where [] indicates that a field is optional. In each case, a file may contain
lines of tab or comma-delimited form. The fields of the second simple format
have the same meaning as in the AAVSO Download Format.  VStar does not support
the AAVSO Space Delimited download format.</p>

<p>Once loaded, you will notice that when the <code>Observation List</code> tab is 
selected, any observation lines VStar deems to have failed validation will appear 
in a separate split pane. Such invalid observations will not appear on any plot.</p>

<p>VStar detects the file's format from its content.</p>

<br></br><h2>Loading Observation Data from AID</h2>

<p>In order to load observations from the AID, you will first need to have a
Citizen Sky account which may be obtained for free from
<a href="http://www.citizensky.org">http://www.citizensky.org</a>.</p>

<p>Selecting <code>New Star from AAVSO Database...</code> from the File menu or
clicking the equivalent toolbar icon opens a dialog that allows one of the stars
from the 10 star tutorial to be selected from a drop-down menu. Alternatively,
a star name from a user-defined star group may selected. The 10 star tutorial 
star group is the only default (see also <em>Setting Preferences</em> section). 
Instead, a star's AAVSO unique ID or alias may be entered.</p>

<p>After selecting the star for which you want to retrieve observation data and 
the Julian Day range (or all data; take care: this may result in a lot of data being 
retrieved), the data for the star's observations within that range are loaded, and 
charts and tables for the data, including means, are created.</p>

<br/><br/><h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Note that as of version 2.10, authentication via login dialog only happens when 
reporting an observation as discrepant (to validate your AAVSO/Citizen Sky username)
which is only possible if the currently loaded dataset is from the AID.</p>

<p>For a given run of VStar, you need to enter your Citizen Sky credentials
only once.</p>

<br/><br/><h2>Observation Details</h2>

<p>By selecting an observation datapoint in a plot with the mouse, a dialog 
is opened with details regarding the observation. This dialog also allows an 
observation to be marked as discrepant and optionally to send a report to AAVSO.
See the Zapper link below for more information about discrepant observations. The 
same dialog can also be opened via the <code>Observation Details...</code> 
<code>View</code> menu item or the equivalent toolbar button.</p>

<br></br><h2>Phase Plots</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>Phase Plot...</code> from the Analysis menu opens a dialogue
where you can enter the period and epoch for a star.  Values from the AAVSO
International Variable Star Index (VSX) are used as the default, if they are
available.  VStar will then fold the data and display a Phase Plot of magnitude
versus phase. Click the <code>New Phase Plot</code> button to change the period
or epoch and generate a new phase plot.</p>

<br></br><h2>Plot Zoom</h2>

<p>Apart from zooming by selecting a bounding box in a plot, or via a chart's 
pop-up menu items, simple zoom in/out View menu items and toolbar buttons are provided.
In order to use the latter, you must first select a point on the plot with the mouse.
This point becomes the focus of subsequent zoom operations.</p>

<br></br><h2>Plot Pan</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>Pan Left</code>, <code>Pan Right</code>, <code>Pan Up</code>, 
or <code>Pan Down</code> from the <code>View</code> menu (or more likely, using 
the corresponding toolbar buttons) will cause the domain (JD, phase) or range 
(magnitude) axis to pan appropriately. This is particularly useful when zooming 
has been applied to a plot and you want to view surrounding data points.</p>

<p><em>When panning left or right to the limit of the available data, selecting 
<codePan Left</code> or <code>Pan Right</code>, accordingly, currently has no further 
effect. In future, the user will be asked whether additional data with a JD less/greater 
than the lower/upper bound should be read from the AID, if that was the source of the 
dataset.</em></p>

<br></br><h2>Observation Filtering</h2>

<p>Selecting the View menu's <code>Filter...</code> item or the corresponding toolbar 
button opens an observation filter dialog that permits one or more "matchers" to be
specified, each of which must match for a given observation to be included in the set 
of filtered observations.</p>

<p>Only raw observations are filtered, not mean values. Observation list rows (for 
raw light curve <em>and</em> phase plot lists) are reduced in number according to 
the filter, and raw light curve plots (not phase plots yet) have a "Filtered" series 
added. <em>This new series can be treated in the same way as any other series, 
including being selected/deselected, and used as the source for a mean curve.</em></p>

<p>If the "Use selected observation?" checkbox is selected, when a matcher is chosen,
its test value field will be taken from the currently selected observation, if there is
one.</p>

<p>Selecting <code>No Filter...</code> from the View menu removes the effect of filtering.</p>

<p>See also the <em>Create your own plug-in!</em> section.</p>

<br></br><h2>Period Search</h2>

<p>Selecting an item from the <code>Analysis->Period Search</code> sub-menu 
performs a period analysis on the loaded dataset. This uses the current mean source 
series (e.g. Visual, Johnson V) as the series on which to perform the analysis. This 
can be changed via the <code>Change Series</code> button (and the ensuing dialog) in 
the <code>Mean Plot</code> tab.</p>

<p>The period analysis dialog that opens after a delay contains plots of
amplitude against frequency and period, a table of all results, and a table of the
top 20 hits ranked by amplitude. The latter is a good starting point for testing
candidate periods. Clicking an entry in this table highlights the corresponding
table entry or data-point in the other views. You can test different candidate 
periods by creating phase plots with those periods.</p>

<p>Currently implemented: Date Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DC DFT). Other 
possibilities: WWZ, AoV (analysis of variance), ...</p>

<p>See also the <em>Create your own plug-in!</em> section.</p>
 
<br></br><h2>Polynomial Fit</h2>

<p>By selecting <code>Analysis->Polynomial Fit</code>, a polynomial of a particular 
degree will be created in an attempt to fit (i.e. model) the currently loaded 
observation data. The current mean source series will be used as the basis for the 
fit.</p>

<p>A polynomial fit series will be added to the light curve plot and made visible.
In addition, a <em>Residuals</em> series (dataset with polynomial removed) is added 
but not initially made visible. See also the <code>Change Series</code> button in the 
light curve pane.</p>

<p><em>A more complete integration of polynomial fit, including the option of saving
residuals and fit coefficients is planned.</em></p>

<br></br><h2>Saving Plots and Tables</h2>

<p>Any chart can be saved as a PNG file via the File menu's <code>Save...</code>
item or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<p><i>Tables in the <code>Observation List</code> tab can be saved as TSV files, but 
<code>Mean List</code> table saving is yet to be implemented. For the latter, what 
may also be needed is to save not just the data, but also the parameters that lead 
to it.</i></p>

<br></br><h2>Printing Plots and Tables</h2>

<p>Any chart or data table can be printed via the File menu's <code>Print...</code>
item or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<br></br><h2>Setting Preferences</h2>

<p>Preferences can be set via the File menu's <code>Preferences...</code> item
or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<p>Per-band colors can be changed and star groups can be created, deleted, and modified.</p>

<br></br><h2>Create your own plug-in!</h2>

<p>VStar's functionality can be extended by developing Java plug-ins for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>loading data from arbitrary sources;</li>
  <li>custom observation filtering;</li>
  <li>alternative period analysis algorithms;</li>
</ul>

among other things. For more information see the Citizen Sky or AAVSO VStar web pages 
(see <em>Links</em> section below).
