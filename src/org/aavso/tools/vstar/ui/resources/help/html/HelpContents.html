  <h1>VStar Help</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>VStar is a multi-platform, easy-to-use variable star data visualization and 
analysis tool.</p>

<p>Its current capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Sourcing data from a file or the AAVSO International Database.</li>
 <li>Plotting a Light Curve or Phase Plot from raw observation data, 
 optionally with error bars for each observation.</li>
 <li>Plotting a mean light curve (again, with optional error bars) along with
 the raw light curve.</li>
 <li>Tables of data corresponding to the plots can also be viewed, with mean 
 data having a table of its own.</li>
 <li>Performing period analysis.</li>
 <li>Filtering observations.</li>
 <li>Extensibility via plug-ins written by the user community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plots have magnitude on the Y axis and Julian Date or phase on the X axis.</p>

<p>In its default configuration, VStar allows data to be loaded from one of two 
file formats or from the AAVSO International Database (AID).</p>

<h2>Loading Observation Data from a File</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>New Star from File...</code> from the File menu or clicking
the equivalent toolbar icon opens a file dialog from which a file of one of two
formats can be loaded:</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href="http://www.aavso.org/format-data-file">AAVSO
 download format</a> (CSV and TSV formats only currently, not VOTable)</li>
 <li>Lines of the form: Julian Date,Magnitude,[Uncertainty],[Observer Code],[Validation Flag]
 or simply: Julian Date,Magnitude</li>
</ol>

<p>where [] indicates that a field is optional. In each case, a file may contain
lines of tab or comma-delimited form. The fields of the second simple format
have the same meaning as in the AAVSO Download Format. VStar does not support
the AAVSO Space Delimited download format.</p>

<p>Once loaded, you will notice that when the <code>Observation List</code> tab is 
selected, any observation lines VStar deems to have failed validation will appear 
in a separate split pane. Such invalid observations will not appear on any plot.</p>

<p>VStar detects the file's format from its content.</p>

<h2>Loading Observation Data from AID</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>New Star from AAVSO Database...</code> from the File menu or
clicking the equivalent toolbar icon opens a dialog that allows one of the stars
from the 10 star tutorial to be selected from a drop-down menu. Alternatively,
a star name from a user-defined star group may selected. The 10 star tutorial 
star group is the only default (see also <em>Setting Preferences</em> section). 
Instead, a star's AAVSO unique ID or alias may be entered.</p>

<p>After selecting the star for which you want to retrieve observation data and 
the Julian Date range (or all data; take care: this may result in a lot of data being 
retrieved), the data for the star's observations within that range are loaded, and 
charts and tables for the data, including means, are created.</p>

<h2>Observation Details</h2>

<p>By selecting an observation datapoint in a plot with the mouse and clicking the 
<code>Observation Details...</code> toolbar button or View menu item,
a dialog is opened with details regarding the observation. This dialog also allows 
an observation to be marked as discrepant and optionally to send a report to AAVSO.
See the Zapper link below for more information about discrepant observations.</p>

<h2>Plot Zoom</h2>

<p>Apart from zooming by selecting a bounding box in a plot, or via a chart's 
pop-up menu items, simple zoom in/out View menu items and toolbar buttons are provided.
In order to use the latter, you must first select a point on the plot with the mouse.
This point becomes the focus of subsequent zoom operations.</p>

<h2>Plot Panning</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>Pan Left</code>, <code>Pan Right</code>, <code>Pan Up</code>, 
or <code>Pan Down</code> from the <code>View</code> menu (or more likely, using 
the corresponding toolbar buttons) will cause the domain (JD, phase) or range 
(magnitude) axis to pan appropriately. This is particularly useful when zooming 
has been applied to a plot and you want to view surrounding data points.</p>

<p><em>When panning left or right to the limit of the available data, selecting 
</em><code>Pan Left</code><em> or </em><code>Pan Right</code><em>, accordingly, 
currently has no further effect.</em></p>

<h2>Phase Plots</h2>

<p>Selecting <code>Phase Plot...</code> from the Analysis menu or clicking the 
corresponding button from the toolbar opens a dialog box into which you can enter 
the period and epoch for a dataset. Period and epoch values from the AAVSO International 
Variable Star Index (VSX) are used as the default, if the dataset was loaded from the 
AID. If unknown or the dataset was loaded from a file, the epoch defaults to the mid-point 
of the dataset's time range. VStar will fold the data over the specified period and display 
a Phase Plot of magnitude versus phase.</p>

<p>After the first phase plot has been created for a dataset, selecting <code>Phase 
Plot...</code> will switch from raw data (light curve) mode to phase plot mode, affecting
both plots and tables. Selecting <code>Raw Data</code> from the Analysis menu will
switch back to raw data (light curve) mode. To create a new phase plot, see the
<em>Plot Control</em> section.</p>

<h2>Plot Control</h2>

<p>Selecting the <code>Plot Control...</code> toolbar button or View menu item opens
a dialog that permits features of the light curve or phase plots to be changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selection of series to be displayed.</li>
  <li>Selection of the series to be used as the source for the mean series.</li>
  <li>Whether or not to show error bars or cross hairs.</li>
  <li>Whether or not data points in the mean series should be joined.</li>
  <li>The number of days or phase steps per bin in the mean curve can be updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>In phase plot mode, a <code>New Phase Plot</code> button is included in the dialog
to change the period or epoch and generate a new phase plot.</p>

<h2>Observation Filtering</h2>

<p>Selecting the View menu's <code>Filter...</code> item or the corresponding toolbar 
button opens an observation filter dialog that permits one or more "matchers" to be
specified, each of which must match for a given observation to be included in the set 
of filtered observations.</p>

<p>Only raw observations are filtered, not mean values. Observation list rows (for 
raw light curve <em>and</em> phase plot lists) are reduced in number according to 
the filter, and raw light curve plots (not phase plots yet) have a "Filtered" series 
added. <em>This new series can be treated in the same way as any other series, 
including being selected/deselected, and used as the source for a mean curve.</em></p>

<p>If the "Use selected observation?" checkbox is selected, when a matcher is chosen,
its test value field will be taken from the currently selected observation, if one
has been selected with the cross-hairs.</p>

<p>Selecting <code>No Filter...</code> from the View menu removes the effect of filtering.</p>

<p>See also the <em>Create your own plug-in!</em> section.</p>

<h2>Period Search</h2>

<p>Selecting an item from the <code>Analysis->Period Search</code> sub-menu 
performs a period analysis on the loaded dataset. This uses the current mean source 
series (e.g. Visual, Johnson V) as the series on which to perform the analysis. This 
can be changed via the <code>Change Series</code> button (and the ensuing dialog) in 
the <code>Mean Plot</code> tab.</p>

<p>The period analysis dialog that opens after a delay contains plots of
amplitude against frequency and period, a table of all results, and a table of the
top 20 hits ranked by amplitude. The latter is a good starting point for testing
candidate periods. Clicking an entry in this table highlights the corresponding
table entry or data-point in the other views. You can test different candidate 
periods by creating phase plots with those periods.</p>

<p>Currently implemented: Date Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DC DFT). Other 
possibilities in future are: WWZ, AoV (analysis of variance), Fast Chi Square.</p>

<p>See also the <em>Create your own plug-in!</em> section.</p>
 
<h2>Polynomial Fit</h2>

<p>By selecting <code>Analysis->Polynomial Fit</code>, a polynomial of a particular 
degree will be created in an attempt to fit (i.e. model) the currently loaded 
observation data. The current mean source series will be used as the basis for the 
fit.</p>

<p>A polynomial fit series will be added to the light curve plot and made visible.
In addition, a <em>Residuals</em> series (dataset with polynomial removed) is added 
but not initially made visible. See also the <code>Change Series</code> button in the 
light curve pane.</p>

<p><em>A more complete integration of polynomial fit, including the option of saving
residuals and fit coefficients will be added in future.</em></p>

<h2>Saving Plots and Tables</h2>

<p>Any chart can be saved as a PNG file via the File menu's <code>Save...</code>
item or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<p><i>Tables in the <code>Observation List</code> tab can be saved as TSV files, but 
<code>Mean List</code> table saving is yet to be implemented. For the latter, what 
may also be needed is to save not just the data, but also the parameters that lead 
to it.</i></p>

<h2>Printing Plots and Tables</h2>

<p>Any chart or data table can be printed via the File menu's <code>Print...</code>
item or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<h2>Setting Preferences</h2>

<p>Preferences can be set via the File menu's <code>Preferences...</code> item
or the equivalent toolbar icon.</p>

<p>Per-band colors can be changed and star groups can be created, deleted, and modified.</p>

<p>The precision of numeric output can also be specified via the preferences dialog.</p>

<p>Other preferences will be added over time.</p>

<h2>Create your own plug-in!</h2>

<p>VStar's functionality can be extended by developing Java plug-ins for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>loading data from arbitrary sources;</li>
  <li>custom observation filtering;</li>
  <li>alternative period analysis algorithms;</li>
</ul>

among other things. For more information see the Citizen Sky or AAVSO VStar web pages 
(see <em>Links</em> section below).

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Note that as of version 2.10, authentication via login dialog only happens when 
reporting an observation as discrepant (to validate your AAVSO or Citizen Sky 
username and password) which is only possible if the currently loaded dataset 
is from the AID.</p>

<p>For a given run of VStar, you need to enter your Citizen Sky credentials
only once.</p>

<p>A Citizen Sky account may be obtained for free from
